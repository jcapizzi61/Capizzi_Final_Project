        <h1>How does religion affect politics and education in the United States?</h1>
        <p>By Julia Capizzi</p>
        <time datetime="2021-02-18">May 24, 2022</time>
        <p>On Monday, May 2, Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank">shared</a> a leaked Supreme Court draft decision that indicates the Court plans to overturn <i>Roe v. Wade</i> this coming June. 
       </p>
        <p>The decision to overturn <i>Roe</i>, which is just one of many political issues with the<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/" target="_blank"> Evangelical Christian movement</a> at its center, has prompted a larger discussion on the effect of religion in American politics. Conservative religions like Evangelical Christianity and Catholicism have played a significant role in our modern political landscape, including the fight <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/02/19/all-we-want-equality/religious-exemptions-and-discrimination-against-lgbt-people" target="_blank">against</a> gay rights and marriage equality and the inclusion of contraceptives in <a href="https://time.com/2941323/supreme-court-contraception-ruling-hobby-lobby/" target="_blank">employer sponsored healthcare</a></p>
        <p>Perhaps one of the most striking examples of religion in American politics is the influence of the Evangelical church over sex education in public schools. Abstinence-only sex education <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5913747/" target="_blank"> consists</a> of sex education teachings that stress abstinence from sexual activity until marriage. The mention of contraceptives, like the birth control pill and condoms, is forbidden.</p> 
        <p>The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.heritage.org/education/report/the-effectiveness-abstinence-education-programs-reducing-sexual-activity-among&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1653159276070920&usg=AOvVaw3Z0pisYZ1xFtct60_a3tFL" target="_blank"> claims</a> abstinence-only sex education is essential to preventing teen pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted infections. But abstinence-only sex education <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/abstinence-only-education-failure" target="_blank"> has proven</a> to be ineffective. Research <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abstinence-only-until-marriage-programs-are-ineffective-and-harmful-young-people" target="_blank"> suggests</a> comprehensive sex education programs that guide students to practice safe sex through the use of contraceptives are more effective at preventing teen pregnancy and STIs. 
        </p>
        <p>Still, only <a href="https://siecus.org/state-profiles-2019-2020/" target="_blank"> 29 states </a> require sex education to be taught in schools while <a href="https://siecus.org/state-profiles-2019-2020/" target="_blank"> 35 states</a> require an emphasis on teaching abstinence until marriage.</p>
            
       <p>According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, also known as SIECUS, the United States government has funded abstinence-only-until-marriage <a href="https://siecus.org/resources/a-history-of-abstinence-only-federal-funding/#:~:text=Beginning%20in%201981%20under%20the,exponentially%20during%20the%20George%20W" target="_blank"> since 1981</a>. The Evangelical Church has played a <a href="https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&context=poli_fac" target="_blank"> major role </a> in American sex education curriculum by lobbying for funding for abstinence-only sex education programs.</p>

        <h1>How religious is America?</h1>
        <h2>The 2020 religious census indicates some surprising factors</h2>
        <p>By Julia Capizzi</p>
        <time datetime="2021-02-18">May 24, 2022</time>
    </header>
    <p>As mentioned above, religion affects more than just sex education in the United States. Many of our modern political issues, from same-sex marriage to healthcare, are influenced by Christian churches and religious organizations lobbying for certain legislation to push their agendas.</p>
     
    <p>In fact, the Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2011/11/21/lobbying-for-the-faithful-exec/#expenditures" target="_blank">claims</a> that “The number of organizations engaged in religious lobbying or religion-related advocacy in Washington, D.C., has increased roughly fivefold in the past four decades, from fewer than 40 in 1970 to more than 200 today.”</p> 
    <p>But is America as religious as these religious lobbying organizations want us to believe?</p>

    <p>The Public Religious Research Institute, a bipartisan research institute, aims to answer this question by studying the affect of religion on American legislation and policy, <a href="https://www.prri.org/about/" target="_blank"> according</a> to their mission statement.</p>

    <p>The Public Religious Research Institute, also known as the P.R.R.I., released their findings in <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/2020-census-of-american-religion/" target="_blank">the 2020 Census of American Religion</a> on July 8, 2021. The census covered a number of topics and demographics, including the state of white Chrisianity in America, the diversity of religious affiliations among young people in the United States, and the political leanings of different religious denominations. 
    </p>
    <p>P.R.R.I.’s report was met with various opinions by major publications, like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/opinion/religious-right-america.html#commentsContainer" target="_blank">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/10/opinions/american-evangelicals-protestantism-butler-bass/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a>. The overwhelming consensus is that while the number of Evangelical Christians is declining, the influence of white Evangelical Christianity is not.  
    </p>
    <p>Other interesting factors in this study include the slowing growth of religious “Nones,” or people who do not have any religious affiliation. The number of Nones, which has increased steadily since 2012, declined at the time this census was taken. P.R.R.I. says that the growth of religious Nones from 2012 to 2020 could be partially credited to white Christians leaving the faith.</p>
    <p>Other factors studied by the P.R.R.I. include the breakdown of religious affiliations by race, ethnicity and age. </p>

                <h3>Age and Religious Affiliation</h3>
                <p>White Christians tend to be older than most other religious affiliations. In fact, the median age for white Evangelical Protestants is 56, while the median age for Hispanic Catholics is 42 and the median age for the religiously unaffiliated is 38. 
                </p>
                <p>The age of the religiously unaffiliated, or “nones” as P.R.R.I. calls them, has decreased in recent years. “In 1986, only 10% of those ages 18–29 identified as religiously unaffiliated. In 2016, that number had increased to 38%, and declined slightly in 2020, to 36%,” says P.R.R.I.</p>

                <h3>Religion and Race</h3>
                <p>Christianity is the leading affiliation among white Americans. According to the P.R.R.I., “71% of white Americans identify as Christian.” With 72% of Black Americans identifying as Christian, is also the leading affiliation among Black Americans.</p>
                <p>Americans who do not identify as Christian are more likely to be religiously unaffiliated. In fact, 23% of white, non-Christian Americans and 21% of Black Americans consider themselves unaffiliated with any religious denomination or organization. The split among Asian American and Pacific Islander Americans is even, however, with 34% identifying as Christian and another 34% identifying as religiously unaffiliated. </p>

                <h3>Religiously Unaffiliated “Nones”</h3>
                <p>While the number of religiously unaffiliated Americans, or Nones, has increased steadily since 2007, this number plateaued and then slowed when this study was conducted in 2020. When the census was last conducted in 2016, 38% of Americans identified as Nones. That number decreased to 36% in 2020. </p>

                <h3>Religious Diversity</h3>
                <p>The P.R.R.I. scored religious diversity among different American counties on a scale of 0.2 (least diverse) to 0.9 (most diverse). P.R.R.I. gave the United States an overall religious diversity score of 0.625.</p>
                <p>The most religious diversity was found in areas near major cities, like Kings County, New York, a county of New York City, and Montgomery County, a county in Maryland near Washington D.C. P.R.R.I. found southern and rural counties to be the least religiously diverse.</p>
